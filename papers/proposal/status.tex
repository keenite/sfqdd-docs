Since we spent a lot of time discussing the feasibility of this
project, we only recently finished SFQ($D^2$)'s design and began
implementation.

Once we fully understood the SFQ and FlashFQ papers, we listed the
points that we could improve. Our next step is to implement SFQ in
Linux. A breakdown of future work is summarized in
Table~\ref{table:traces}.
